# 30-team-based-access-control-model

The 30-team-based-access-control-model is a security framework designed to manage access to resources within an organization, emphasizing team-based permissions to enhance collaboration and security. This model matters because it balances the need for access with the need for security, making it a crucial component of modern access control systems. By implementing this model, organizations can reduce the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.

## The Problem It Solves
The 30-team-based-access-control-model solves the problem of overly permissive access control, where individuals have more access than necessary, and the lack of flexibility in traditional role-based access control systems. This leads to a higher risk of insider threats, data breaches, and compliance issues. The pain is clearly felt in organizations where sensitive data is compromised due to inadequate access controls.

## How to Think About It
To understand the 30-team-based-access-control-model, think of it as a dynamic, team-centric approach to access control. It behaves like a matrix, connecting teams, roles, and resources to ensure that access is granted based on a user's team membership and role within that team. This reframes the traditional access control problem by focusing on teams rather than individual users, making it easier to manage access in collaborative environments.

## Core Truths
List the essential principles that always apply.
- **Least Privilege**: Access should be granted based on the minimum required for a team to perform its tasks.
- **Separation of Duties**: Teams should be designed to separate sensitive tasks and reduce the risk of a single team having too much access.
- **Dynamic Membership**: Team membership and access should be dynamic, reflecting changes in the organization and user roles.

## What It Looks Like in Practice
In practice, the 30-team-based-access-control-model is typically used in real situations where teams need to collaborate on projects that require access to sensitive resources. The intent is to ensure that teams have the necessary access to perform their tasks while minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. The structure involves defining teams, roles within those teams, and the resources each team requires access to.

## Where People Go Wrong
Common misunderstandings or misuses.
- **Overly Broad Team Definitions**: Defining teams too broadly can lead to overly permissive access, undermining the security benefits of the model.
- **Insufficient Role Separation**: Failing to separate roles within teams can lead to a concentration of access and increase the risk of insider threats.

## When to Use It and When Not To
Define clear boundaries.
**Use it when**
- **Collaborative Projects**: The model is well-suited for projects that require collaboration among multiple teams with varying levels of access.
- **Dynamic Environments**: It is ideal for organizations with frequently changing team structures or project requirements.

**Avoid it when**
- **Simple Access Control Needs**: For simple access control needs where traditional role-based access control is sufficient, the 30-team-based-access-control-model may introduce unnecessary complexity.
- **Very Small Teams**: For very small teams or individual contributors, the overhead of managing team-based access control may not be justified.

## One Line to Remember
The 30-team-based-access-control-model is a flexible, team-centric approach to access control that balances security with collaboration by granting access based on team membership and role.
