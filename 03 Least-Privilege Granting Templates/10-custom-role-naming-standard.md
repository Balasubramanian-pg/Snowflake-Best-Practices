## The Problem It Solves
What specific problem or tension led to the need for 10-custom-role-naming-standard?  
The lack of a standardized naming convention for custom roles can lead to confusion, errors, and security vulnerabilities, as role names may be duplicated, unclear, or difficult to manage. This can result in unauthorized access, data breaches, or compliance issues, ultimately compromising the integrity of the system.

## How to Think About It
Describe the mental model for understanding this topic.  
To understand the 10-custom-role-naming-standard, it's essential to consider the role naming process as a critical component of identity and access management. This involves thinking about role names as unique identifiers that must be descriptive, concise, and consistent, while also being mindful of the potential risks and consequences of inadequate role naming. By reframing role naming as a strategic process, organizations can better manage access, reduce errors, and improve security.

## Core Truths
List the essential principles that always apply.
- **Uniqueness**: Each custom role must have a unique name to prevent conflicts and ensure accurate identification.
- **Descriptiveness**: Role names should clearly indicate the role's purpose, responsibilities, and scope to facilitate understanding and management.
- **Consistency**: A standardized naming convention should be applied consistently across all custom roles to maintain clarity and organization.

## What It Looks Like in Practice
