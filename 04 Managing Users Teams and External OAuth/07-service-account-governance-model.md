# 07-service-account-governance-model

What is 07-service-account-governance-model and why does it matter?  
The 07-service-account-governance-model refers to a structured approach to managing service accounts within an organization, ensuring that these accounts are properly created, maintained, and monitored to prevent security risks and compliance issues. This model matters because it helps organizations maintain control over their digital identities and access, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. Effective service account governance is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of an organization's systems and data.

## The Problem It Solves
What specific problem or tension led to the need for 07-service-account-governance-model?  
The lack of a structured governance model for service accounts can lead to a proliferation of unmanaged accounts, each with its own set of permissions and access rights, creating a significant security risk. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, systems, and applications, potentially leading to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. The problem is further complicated by the fact that service accounts are often used by automated processes and systems, making it difficult to track and monitor their activity.

## How to Think About It
Describe the mental model for understanding this topic.  
To understand the 07-service-account-governance-model, it's essential to think about service accounts as digital identities that require the same level of governance and management as human identities. This means considering the entire lifecycle of a service account, from creation to decommissioning, and ensuring that each account is properly provisioned, monitored, and terminated when no longer needed. It's also crucial to consider the principles of least privilege and separation of duties, ensuring that each service account has only the necessary permissions and access rights to perform its intended function.

## Core Truths
List the essential principles that always apply.
- **Least Privilege**: Service accounts should be granted only the necessary permissions and access rights to perform their intended function.
- **Separation of Duties**: Service accounts should be designed to perform a single function or set of related functions, with clear separation of duties to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Service accounts should be properly managed throughout their entire lifecycle, from creation to decommissioning, to prevent security risks and compliance issues.

## What It Looks Like in Practice
Briefly explain how 07-service-account-governance-model is typically used in real situations.  
In practice, the 07-service-account-governance-model involves implementing a structured approach to service account management, including the creation of a service account catalog, regular audits and reviews, and the implementation of automated workflows to provision and deprovision service accounts. This approach helps organizations ensure that service accounts are properly managed, monitored, and terminated when no longer needed, reducing the risk of security breaches and compliance issues.

## Where People Go Wrong
Common misunderstandings or misuses.
- **Overprovisioning**: Granting service accounts excessive permissions and access rights, increasing the risk of security breaches and unauthorized access.
- **Lack of Monitoring**: Failing to regularly monitor and review service account activity, making it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents.

## When to Use It and When Not To
Define clear boundaries.
**Use it when**
- **Automated Processes**: Service accounts are used to automate processes and systems, requiring a structured approach to governance and management.
- **Sensitive Data**: Service accounts have access to sensitive data or systems, requiring enhanced security and compliance measures.

**Avoid it when**
- **Simple Scripts**: Service accounts are used for simple scripts or tasks that do not require extensive governance and management.
- **Development Environments**: Service accounts are used in development environments where security and compliance requirements are less stringent.
