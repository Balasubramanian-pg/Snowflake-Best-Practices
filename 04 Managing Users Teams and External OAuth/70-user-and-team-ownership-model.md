# 70-user-and-team-ownership-model

The 70-user-and-team-ownership-model refers to a framework where 70% of the decision-making authority and ownership are delegated to users and teams, while 30% is retained by leadership, enabling a balance between autonomy and oversight. This model matters because it fosters a culture of empowerment, accountability, and collaboration, leading to increased productivity and job satisfaction. By distributing ownership, organizations can tap into the collective wisdom and expertise of their teams.

## The Problem It Solves
The traditional top-down approach to decision-making can lead to disengagement, lack of motivation, and slow response times, as teams wait for instructions from leadership. This can result in missed opportunities, decreased innovation, and reduced competitiveness. The 70-user-and-team-ownership-model addresses this problem by giving teams the autonomy to make decisions and take ownership of their work.

## How to Think About It
To understand the 70-user-and-team-ownership-model, it's essential to adopt a mindset that values empowerment, trust, and collaboration. This model behaves like a dynamic system, where teams are given the freedom to make decisions, and leadership provides guidance and support as needed. It connects ideas by recognizing that teams are closer to the problems and have a deeper understanding of the solutions. This model reframes the problem of decision-making by shifting the focus from control to enablement.
