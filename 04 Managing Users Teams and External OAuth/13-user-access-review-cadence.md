# 13-user-access-review-cadence

What is 13-user-access-review-cadence and why does it matter?  
The 13-user-access-review-cadence refers to a periodic review process of user access to ensure that access rights are up-to-date and aligned with the current roles and responsibilities of users. This process is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of an organization's systems and data. Regular reviews help prevent unauthorized access and reduce the risk of data breaches.

## The Problem It Solves
What specific problem or tension led to the need for 13-user-access-review-cadence?  
The problem of outdated or excessive user access permissions, which can lead to security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This issue arises when user roles change, employees leave the organization, or new systems are introduced, and access rights are not updated accordingly.

## How to Think About It
Describe the mental model for understanding this topic.  
To understand 13-user-access-review-cadence, think of it as a recurring audit process that connects user identity, access management, and security governance. It reframes the problem of access management from a static to a dynamic process, recognizing that user roles and responsibilities change over time.

## Core Truths
List the essential principles that always apply.
- Principle one: Regular reviews are necessary to ensure access rights are aligned with current user roles and responsibilities.
- Principle two: Access reviews should be based on a clear understanding of the organization's security policies and regulatory requirements.
- Principle three: The review process should be automated and integrated with existing identity and access management systems to minimize manual errors.

## What It Looks Like in Practice
Briefly explain how 13-user-access-review-cadence is typically used in real situations.  
In practice, 13-user-access-review-cadence involves scheduling regular reviews of user access, typically quarterly or bi-annually, to verify that access rights are still necessary and appropriate. The review process involves identifying and removing unnecessary access, updating access permissions, and documenting changes.

## Where People Go Wrong
Common misunderstandings or misuses.
- Mistake one and why it is tempting: Failing to automate the review process, leading to manual errors and inconsistent application of access policies.
- Mistake two and its hidden cost: Not integrating access reviews with identity and access management systems, resulting in duplicated effort and increased risk of security breaches.

## When to Use It and When Not To
Define clear boundaries.
**Use it when**
- Scenario one: When an organization has a large and dynamic user base with frequently changing roles and responsibilities.
- Scenario two: When regulatory requirements mandate regular access reviews, such as in the financial or healthcare sectors.

**Avoid it when**
- Scenario one: When an organization has a small and stable user base with minimal changes to access requirements.
- Scenario two: When the cost of implementing and maintaining a regular access review process outweighs the potential security benefits.

## One Line to Remember
