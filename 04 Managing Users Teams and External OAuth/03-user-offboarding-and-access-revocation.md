# 03-user-offboarding-and-access-revocation

What is 03-user-offboarding-and-access-revocation and why does it matter?  
User offboarding and access revocation is the process of removing a user's access to an organization's systems, data, and resources when they leave the organization or their role changes. This process is crucial for maintaining security, preventing data breaches, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. It also helps to protect the organization's intellectual property and sensitive information.

## The Problem It Solves
What specific problem or tension led to the need for 03-user-offboarding-and-access-revocation?  
The problem of user offboarding and access revocation arises when an employee leaves an organization, and their access to sensitive information and systems is not promptly revoked, leaving the organization vulnerable to insider threats, data breaches, and unauthorized access. This can lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.

## How to Think About It
Describe the mental model for understanding this topic.  
To understand user offboarding and access revocation, it's essential to think about it as a critical component of an organization's overall identity and access management (IAM) strategy. It involves a systematic approach to deprovisioning access, removing privileges, and ensuring that all access points are closed when a user leaves the organization. This mental model connects ideas around identity management, access control, and security, and reframes the problem of user offboarding as an opportunity to strengthen the organization's security posture.

## Core Truths
List the essential principles that always apply.

- Principle one: Prompt removal of access is essential to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Principle two: A systematic and automated approach to offboarding is more effective than a manual one.
- Principle three: Offboarding should be a continuous process that is integrated with the organization's overall IAM strategy.

## What It Looks Like in Practice
Briefly explain how 03-user-offboarding-and-access-revocation is typically used in real situations.  
In practice, user offboarding and access revocation typically involve a coordinated effort between HR, IT, and management to ensure that all access points are removed, including email, network access, and application privileges. This process is often automated through IAM systems and involves regular audits to ensure that access is properly revoked.

## Where People Go Wrong
Common misunderstandings or misuses.

- Mistake one and why it is tempting: Failing to automate the offboarding process, which can lead to delays and oversights, and is tempting because it may seem like a one-time task that can be done manually.
- Mistake two and its hidden cost: Not integrating offboarding with the overall IAM strategy, which can lead to inconsistent access controls and increased security risks, and has a hidden cost of increased vulnerability to insider threats.

## When to Use It and When Not To
Define clear boundaries.

**Use it when**
- Scenario one: An employee leaves the organization, and their access needs to be removed to prevent unauthorized access.
- Scenario two: A contractor's or vendor's access needs to be revoked when their project is completed or their contract is terminated.

**Avoid it when**
- Scenario one: An employee is taking a leave of absence, and their access may need to be temporarily suspended rather than revoked.
- Scenario two: An employee is changing roles within the organization, and their access needs to be modified rather than revoked.

## One Line to Remember
A single sentence that captures the essence of 03-user-offboarding-and-access-revocation.

User offboarding and access revocation is a critical security process that ensures the prompt removal of access and privileges when a user leaves an organization or their role changes.
