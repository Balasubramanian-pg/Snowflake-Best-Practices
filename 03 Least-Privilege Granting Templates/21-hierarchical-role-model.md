# 21-hierarchical-role-model

The 21-hierarchical-role-model is a framework for understanding and organizing roles within an organization, emphasizing a hierarchical structure with 21 distinct roles. This model matters because it provides a clear and comprehensive approach to role definition, helping organizations to better manage responsibilities and improve overall efficiency. By adopting this model, organizations can streamline their operations and enhance collaboration among team members.

## The Problem It Solves
The need for the 21-hierarchical-role-model arose from the challenges organizations face in defining and managing roles, leading to confusion, overlap, and inefficiencies. Without a clear role structure, organizations often experience difficulties in assigning responsibilities, evaluating performance, and making informed decisions about personnel and resource allocation. This lack of clarity can result in role confusion, communication breakdowns, and decreased productivity.

## How to Think About It
To understand the 21-hierarchical-role-model, it's essential to think about roles as a hierarchical system, where each role has a specific set of responsibilities, authorities, and relationships with other roles. This mental model helps to connect ideas about organizational structure, role definition, and collaboration, reframing the problem of role management as a matter of designing and implementing a clear, hierarchical role system. By considering the interdependencies and interactions between roles, organizations can create a more cohesive and effective role structure.

## Core Truths
List the essential principles that always apply.
- Roles are the building blocks of an organization's structure
- Each role has a unique set of responsibilities and authorities
- Roles are interconnected and interdependent, forming a hierarchical system

## What It Looks Like in Practice
In practice, the 21-hierarchical-role-model is typically used to design and implement role-based access control, role-based training and development programs, and role-based performance evaluation systems. The focus is on creating a clear and consistent role structure, with well-defined responsibilities, authorities, and relationships between roles, enabling organizations to manage roles more effectively and improve overall performance.

## Where People Go Wrong
Common misunderstandings or misuses.
- Assuming that roles are static and unchanging, rather than dynamic and evolving, and why it is tempting due to the desire for stability and predictability
- Failing to consider the interdependencies between roles, and its hidden cost, including role confusion, communication breakdowns, and decreased productivity

## When to Use It and When Not To
Define clear boundaries.
**Use it when**
- An organization is experiencing role confusion or overlap
- There is a need to streamline role-based processes, such as access control or performance evaluation

**Avoid it when**
- The organization is very small, with fewer than 10 employees, and a simple, flat structure is sufficient
- The organization is undergoing significant change or transformation, and a more flexible, adaptive approach to role management is required

## One Line to Remember
The 21-hierarchical-role-model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and organizing roles within an organization, enabling more effective role management and improved overall performance.
