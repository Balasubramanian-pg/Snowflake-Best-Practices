# 74-zero-trust-access-model

What is 74-zero-trust-access-model and why does it matter?  
The 74-zero-trust-access-model, also known as Zero Trust Architecture, is a security approach that assumes no user or device is trustworthy, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network. This model matters because it provides a robust security framework to protect against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. It's a critical concept in today's digital landscape, where security breaches can have devastating consequences.

## The Problem It Solves
What specific problem or tension led to the need for 74-zero-trust-access-model?  
The traditional perimeter-based security model, which relies on a "castle and moat" approach, is no longer effective in today's complex and dynamic IT environments. The problem is that this traditional model assumes that everything inside the network is trustworthy, which is not the case, especially with the rise of remote work, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies, and cloud computing. This has led to a significant increase in lateral movement attacks, where attackers move undetected within the network, exploiting vulnerabilities and stealing sensitive data.

## How to Think About It
Describe the mental model for understanding this topic.  
To understand the 74-zero-trust-access-model, it's essential to think of security as a continuous process, rather than a one-time event. This model requires a shift in mindset, from a perimeter-based approach to a identity-based approach, where access is granted based on the user's identity, device, and context. It's also important to consider the concept of "least privilege," where users and devices are granted only the necessary access and permissions to perform their tasks, reducing the attack surface.

## Core Truths
List the essential principles that always apply.

- **Default Deny**: All traffic is denied by default, and access is only granted to specific users and devices based on their identity, device, and context.
- **Least Privilege**: Users and devices are granted only the necessary access and permissions to perform their tasks, reducing the attack surface.
- **Continuous Verification**: The security posture of users and devices is continuously monitored and verified, to ensure that they remain trustworthy.

## What It Looks Like in Practice
Briefly explain how 74-zero-trust-access-model is typically used in real situations.  
In practice, the 74-zero-trust-access-model is typically used to secure access to sensitive data and applications, such as financial systems, customer data, and intellectual property. This is achieved through a combination of technologies, including multi-factor authentication, identity and access management, network segmentation, and encryption.

## Where People Go Wrong
Common misunderstandings or misuses.

- **Over-reliance on Technology**: Many organizations mistakenly believe that implementing Zero Trust is solely a technological problem, and that buying the right tools is enough to achieve Zero Trust. However, Zero Trust requires a fundamental shift in security culture and processes.
- **Lack of Continuous Monitoring**: Another common mistake is to assume that Zero Trust is a one-time implementation, rather than an ongoing process. Continuous monitoring and verification are essential to ensuring that the security posture of users and devices remains up-to-date.

## When to Use It and When Not To
Define clear boundaries.

**Use it when**
- **Sensitive Data is Involved**: Zero Trust is particularly useful when sensitive data is involved, such as financial information, customer data, or intellectual property.
- **High-Risk Environments**: Zero Trust is also useful in high-risk environments, such as government agencies, healthcare organizations, or financial institutions.

**Avoid it when**
- **Low-Risk Environments**: Zero Trust may not be necessary in low-risk environments, such as small businesses or personal devices.
- **Simple Security Requirements**: Zero Trust may be overkill for simple security requirements, such as basic web applications or low-sensitivity data.

## One Line to Remember
A single sentence that captures the essence of 74-zero-trust-access-model.

The 74-zero-trust-access-model is a security approach that assumes no user or device is trustworthy, and grants access based on identity, device, and context, to provide a robust security framework against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.
