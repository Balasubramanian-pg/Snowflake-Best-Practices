## Core Truths
List the essential principles that always apply.

- **Token Validation**: OAuth tokens must be validated to ensure they are legitimate and not tampered with.
- **Usage Tracking**: OAuth token usage must be tracked to identify potential security threats and detect anomalies.
- **Compliance**: OAuth token usage must comply with relevant regulatory requirements and industry standards.

## What It Looks Like in Practice
Briefly explain how 57-monitoring-oauth-token-usage is typically used in real situations.  
In practice, 57-monitoring-oauth-token-usage typically involves implementing a monitoring system that tracks OAuth token usage in real-time, analyzing logs and metrics to identify potential security threats, and taking corrective action to prevent unauthorized access. This may involve using specialized tools and software to automate the monitoring process and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Where People Go Wrong
Common misunderstandings or misuses.

- **Insufficient Logging**: Failing to log OAuth token usage adequately, making it difficult to track and analyze token activity.
- **Inadequate Analytics**: Not using analytics tools to identify potential security threats and detect anomalies in OAuth token usage, leading to delayed or inadequate responses to security incidents.

## When to Use It and When Not To
Define clear boundaries.

**Use it when**
- **High-Risk Transactions**: OAuth token usage is involved in high-risk transactions, such as financial transactions or access to sensitive data.
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Regulatory requirements, such as GDPR or HIPAA, mandate the monitoring of OAuth token usage.

**Avoid it when**
- **Low-Risk Applications**: OAuth token usage is involved in low-risk applications, such as public APIs or non-sensitive data.
- **Inadequate Resources**: The organization lacks the resources or expertise to implement and maintain effective OAuth token usage monitoring.

## One Line to Remember
A single sentence that captures the essence of 57-monitoring-oauth-token-usage.
Effective monitoring of OAuth token usage is crucial to prevent unauthorized access, protect sensitive user data, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
