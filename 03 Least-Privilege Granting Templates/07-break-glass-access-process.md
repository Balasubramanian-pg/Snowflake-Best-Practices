# 07-break-glass-access-process

What is 07-break-glass-access-process and why does it matter?  
The 07-break-glass-access-process refers to a security protocol that allows authorized individuals to access sensitive information or systems during emergency situations, bypassing normal access controls. This process is crucial in ensuring business continuity and minimizing the impact of critical incidents. It provides a controlled and auditable mechanism for accessing sensitive resources in exceptional circumstances.

## The Problem It Solves
What specific problem or tension led to the need for 07-break-glass-access-process?  
The need for 07-break-glass-access-process arises from the tension between maintaining the security and integrity of sensitive information and systems, and the need for rapid access to these resources in emergency situations, such as system failures, natural disasters, or major security incidents, where timely intervention is critical to prevent or mitigate significant harm.

## How to Think About It
Describe the mental model for understanding this topic.  
To understand the 07-break-glass-access-process, one should think about it as a carefully managed exception to standard security protocols, designed to balance the need for security with the need for emergency access. It involves a mindset that considers the potential risks and benefits of bypassing normal access controls and implements strict oversight and auditing to ensure that such access is granted responsibly and only when absolutely necessary.

## Core Truths
List the essential principles that always apply.
- **Emergency Access**: The primary purpose of the 07-break-glass-access-process is to provide access in genuine emergency situations where normal access protocols cannot be followed.
- **Authorization and Approval**: Access should only be granted to authorized individuals who have undergone proper vetting and approval processes.
- **Auditing and Oversight**: All instances of break-glass access must be thoroughly logged, monitored, and subject to post-event review to ensure compliance with policies and to identify areas for improvement.

## What It Looks Like in Practice
Briefly explain how 07-break-glass-access-process is typically used in real situations.  
In practice, the 07-break-glass-access-process involves a structured procedure where authorized personnel can request emergency access to sensitive systems or data. This request is typically reviewed and approved by a designated authority, and once access is granted, all activities are closely monitored and recorded for later review.

## Where People Go Wrong
Common misunderstandings or misuses.
- **Overuse and Misuse**: One common mistake is using the break-glass process for convenience rather than in genuine emergency situations, which can lead to security breaches and undermine the integrity of access controls.
- **Lack of Oversight**: Failing to properly audit and review break-glass access instances can lead to undetected misuse and compromise the security posture of an organization.

## When to Use It and When Not To
Define clear boundaries.
**Use it when**
- **Critical System Failure**: In cases where a critical system failure necessitates immediate access to restore service or prevent data loss.
- **Security Incident Response**: During the response to a major security incident where access to sensitive information is required to contain and mitigate the threat.

**Avoid it when**
- **Routine Maintenance**: For routine maintenance or updates where normal access protocols can be followed.
- **Convenience**: As a convenience to bypass standard security procedures for non-emergency situations.

## One Line to Remember
A single sentence that captures the essence of 07-break-glass-access-process.
The 07-break-glass-access-process is a controlled emergency protocol that balances security with the need for rapid access to sensitive resources in critical situations.
